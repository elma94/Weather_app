# Weather app

Weather app is my greatest achievement in terms of coding. 
This was a first time for me to get to know what API stands for and how to retrieve data from a certain source and represent it through website application.
I used AJAX technique to fetch data.
Final product is a website application which uses information from OpenWeatherMap API thorugh unique key.

Biggest challenge was writing an actual code, understanding asynchronous functions and placing data from API into a HTML components.
